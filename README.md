# Password-Validation-using-RegEx-library
## Descreption
In this project I used the `RegEx` library and the `Tkinter` library in python to create a simple window to check for the password validation.

### Password Validation Critria:
1. Check for the length of the password.
2. Check for containing lowercase and uppercase letters.
3. Check for containing digits and spectial characters.

### Visuals
1. Made dynamic window using `Tkinter` to enter the password.
2. You have the choice to show or hide password.
3. The entered password is being reviewed by the Password Validation function to check for the strength of the password.
