# Password-Validation-using-RegEx-library
##Descreption
In this project I used the `RegEx` library and the `Tkinter` library in python to create a simple window to check for the password validation.

###Password Validation Critria:
1. Check for the length of the password.
2. Check for containing lowercase and uppercase letters.
3. Check for containing digits and spectial characters.
